# Installation
1. Start by initialising Conda.
```bash
conda init bash && bash
```

2. Change the default conda environment location. This ensures it is not necessary to reinstall the environment each time you restart a Notebook instance. This command needs to be rerun each time you restart the instance.
```bash
conda config --append envs_dirs /home/ec2-user/SageMaker/.conda/envs
```

3. Create the environment.
```bash
conda create -n gbmhackathon -y python=3.10
conda activate gbmhackathon
```

4. Install the dependencies.
```bash
cd /home/ec2-user/SageMaker
git clone git@github.com:owkin/gbm_hackathon.git
cd gbm_hackathon
make install-poetry
make install-all
pre-commit install
```

Note that this also makes your environment visible in Jupyter.


# Starter Notebooks
To help you start working quickly on the data, we provided you with the following starter Notebooks.
- `notebooks/data_loader_demo.ipynb` Will help you understand the data loading and which data sources (modalities) are available.
- `notebooks/visium_starter_mosaic.ipynb` Will help you load and explore the Visium data. This includes performing data normalization, unsupervised clustering, and quantifying cell population and transcription factor activities.

We hope these Notebooks will help you with your data analyses!
